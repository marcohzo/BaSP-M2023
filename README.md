## Week 1: Gym Management System Design and Functionality

### Designing the System Using Figma

We started by creating a detailed design using Figma. This included designing the screens for each part of the system and ensuring that the user interface was intuitive and user-friendly. We also created a style guide for the system to ensure consistency in the design elements and branding.

### Creating the Connections Between Screens and Functionalities

Once the design was complete, we began creating the connections between screens and functionalities for the different user types. We created separate  pages for clients, admins, superadmins, and trainers to ensure that each user type had access to the appropriate features and functionalities.

### System Parts

The project was divided into different parts to ensure that each user type had access to the features and functionalities they needed:

- **Landing Page:** A landing page that introduced the system and its features.
- **Sign Up/Log In:** Pages where users could create an account and log in to access their profile and other features.
- **Members:** Regular users who have access to the gym facilities and can book classes and training sessions.
- **Trainers:** Fitness professionals who provide personal training and coaching services to our members.
- **Admins:** Staff members who manage the gym, create schedules, and handle member inquiries and support.
- **Superadmins:** High-level staff members who manage the gym and have full control over the system's features and settings.

## Conclusion

By the end of the first week, we had successfully designed the gym management system using Figma and created the connections between screens and functionalities for each user type.


## Week 2: Gym Management System Landing Page in HTML

In week 2, we continued our work on the gym management system by creating the landing page using HTML. The landing page has the following functions:

- Home: A landing page that introduces our system and its features.
- Sign Up: A page where new users can create an account and become members of the gym.
- Log In: A page where existing members can log in to their account to access their profile and other features.
- Info: A page where users can learn more about our company and its history.
- Contact Information: A section with information on how to contact us for support or inquiries.
- Features: A page that describes the features and benefits.

### Conclusion

We've created a landing page using pure HTML. This page includes all the necessary features to showcase the features of our gym manager system to potential customers. In the coming weeks, we will continue to refine our design and functionality
