# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 2: HTML

In week 2, we continued our work on the gym management system by creating the landing page structure using HTML. The page includes the following content:

- A header with a logo that represents our brand.
- A navigation bar that allows users to sign up, log in, access information, and contact us.
- A welcome section that greets visitors and provides a brief introduction to our software.
- A contact section that provides information on how to get in touch with us for support or inquiries.
- An info section that allows users to learn more about our company's background and history.
- A features section that describes the main functions of our software.
- A membership plans section that provides subscription details.
- Social media links to our company's profiles on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram.

## Week 3 CSS

In week 3, we continued to work on the landing page, this time focusing on styling it based on the Figma model we were provided with. 
We worked with CSS to style the page, using classes, margins, background colors also installed custom fonts from Google to enhance the design. 
We used the "pixel perfect" approach to ensure that our page matched the design precisely. 
We did not use flexbox or grid, instead relying on tools such as display: inline-block to position elements. 
It was important for us to use the 'px' unit of measurement.
