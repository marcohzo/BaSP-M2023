# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 2: HTML

In week 2, we continued our work on the gym management system by creating the landing page structure using HTML. The page includes the following content:

- A header with a logo that represents our brand.
- A navigation bar that allows users to sign up, log in, access information, and contact us.
- A welcome section that greets visitors and provides a brief introduction to our software.
- A contact section that provides information on how to get in touch with us for support or inquiries.
- An info section that allows users to learn more about our company's background and history.
- A features section that describes the main functions of our software.
- A membership plans section that provides subscription details.
- Social media links to our company's profiles on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram.

## Week 3: CSS

In week 3, we continued to work on the landing page, this time focusing on styling it based on the Figma model we were provided with.
We worked with CSS to style the page, using classes, margins, background colors also installed custom fonts from Google to enhance the design.
We used the "pixel perfect" approach to ensure that our page matched the design precisely.
We did not use flexbox or grid, instead relying on tools such as display: inline-block to position elements.
It was important for us to use the 'px' unit of measurement.

## Week 4: Responsive Design

In week 4, we focused on making the page responsive and mobile-first using flexbox, media queries, and percentages.

- We used breakpoints at 601px and 1024px to adjust the layout and content of the page for different screen sizes. By using media queries, we were able to apply different styles to the same elements based on the size of the viewport.
- We also utilized flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Week 5: JavaScript

This week we focused on JavaScript and covered several topics. Each one had a corresponding exercise that we completed and organized into separate folders.

Here is a breakdown of the topics we covered:

- ### 01 variables and operators

- ### 02 strings

- ### 03 arrays

- ### 04 if else

- ### 05 for

- ### 06 functions

- ### Responsive Design

## Week 6: Form Validations with JavaScript

In week 6, we learned how to create custom form validations using JavaScript methods, for loops, comparisons, if statements, among others. Some of the validations we created include:

- Validation of text fields such as name, address, and postal code.
- Validation of email and phone number fields.
- Validation of date field with a specific format and future date restriction.
- Implementation of customized error messages for each form field.
- We also learned how to create a responsive design for the form using media queries and flexbox to adapt to different screen sizes.

## Week 7: Asynchronous Programming and Fetch API

During week 7, we delved into the topic of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, including promises, async/await, and the Fetch API. We focused on using these techniques to make HTTP requests and handle the resulting data.

Some of the key concepts we covered include:

- Understanding asynchronous programming and the event loop
- Working with promises and handling asynchronous data
- Using the Fetch API to make HTTP requests and handle responses
- Query parameters to send data with HTTP requests
- Storing data in local storage
- Using async/await to simplify asynchronous code and handle errors

We put our newfound knowledge into practice by building a web application that retrieves data from an API using Fetch and query parameters, and then displays the data on the page. We also utilized local storage to store data for future use.

Overall, this week was focused on understanding how to effectively work with asynchronous data and HTTP requests in JavaScript, and the various tools and techniques available to make this process simpler and more efficient.
