## Week 2: Gym Management System Landing Page in HTML

In week 2, we continued our work on the gym management system by creating the landing page structure using HTML. The page includes the following content:

- A header with a logo that represents our brand.
- A navigation bar that allows users to sign up, log in, access information, and contact us.
- A welcome section that greets visitors and provides a brief introduction to our software.
- A contact section that provides information on how to get in touch with us for support or inquiries.
- An info section that allows users to learn more about our company's background and history.
- A features section that describes the main functions of our software.
- A membership plans section that provides subscription details.
- Social media links to our company's profiles on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram.

### Conclusion

We've created a landing page structure using pure HTML. This page includes everything necessary to showcase the features of our gym management system to potential customers. In the coming weeks, we will continue to refine our design and functionality.
